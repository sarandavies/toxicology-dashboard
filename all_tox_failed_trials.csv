NCT00901927,"Bendamustine, Mitoxantrone, and Rituximab (BMR) for Patients With Untreated High Risk Follicular Lymphoma","The Study Drugs:

Bendamustine is designed to damage and destroy the DNA (genetic material) of cancer cells.

Mitoxantrone is designed to stop cancer cells from making DNA, which may stop the cells from making more cells.

Rituximab is designed to attach to lymphoma cells, which may cause them to die.

Study Drug Administration:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs in 28-day ""cycles.""

On Days 1 and 2 of each cycle, you will receive bendamustine through a needle in a vein over 30-60 minutes.

On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive rituximab by vein over several hours, depending on how well you tolerate it. Usually, the first dose of rituximab is given over 6-8 hours. If you tolerate the first dose well, you will receive the next doses over 4 hours.

On Day 2 of each cycle, you will receive mitoxantrone by vein over 15 minutes.

Study Visits:

At every study visit (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle), your vital signs will be measured. You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects and to list any drugs you may be taking. The measurement of vital signs on Days 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle may be done by your personal doctor, and the results can be sent in to the study staff.

On Day 1 of each cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.
* Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
* You will have a performance status evaluation.

On Days 8, 15, and 22 of each cycles, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. These tests may be performed by your personal doctor, and the results can be sent in to the study staff.

At the end of Cycle 3, you will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and/or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

If your bone marrow showed lymphoma at the beginning of the study, you will have an additional bone marrow aspiration and biopsy if the disease goes away while you are on study. This will be to check the status of the disease.

If at any time the doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have extra blood and urine collected for routine tests.

Length of Study Participation:

You may receive up to 6 cycles (about 6 months) of study treatment. If the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur, you will be taken off study treatment early.

End-of-Study Visit:

At 30-40 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.
* You will have a performance status evaluation.
* Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
* You will have CT and PET scans to check the status of the disease.
* You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects and to list any drugs you may be taking.

Long-Term Follow-Up:

Every 3 months for 2 years after your study treatment ends, you will have follow-up visits. If after 2 years your body shows no signs of cancer, you will have follow-up visits every 6 months after that. These follow-up tests are considered routine care.

The following tests and procedures will be performed at these visits:

* You will have a performance status evaluation.
* Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
* You will be asked how you are doing and whether you are receiving any new treatments for the disease.
* You will have CT and PET scans to check the status of the disease.
* The study doctor will check the results of any other scans and tests you may have for routine care. The study doctor will also check the results of physical exams you may have.

This is an investigational study. All 3 study drugs are commercially available. Rituximab is FDA approved to treat follicular lymphoma. Mitoxantrone is FDA approved for use in combination for certain types of leukemia. Bendamustine is FDA approved to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The combination of rituximab, mitoxantrone, and bendamustine is not FDA approved to treat follicular lymphoma. At this time, it is only being used in research.

NCT00565227,Phase I Study of Vorinostat in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced and Relapsed Solid Malignancies.,"Vorinostat (also known as Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid) is a new investigational drug that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This drug has shown promising activity against a number of cancers. We want to determine if treatment with vorinostat in combination with a standard type of chemotherapy (docetaxel \[Taxotere™\]) is safe and possibly better than treatment with docetaxel alone. We also want to find out more about how patients and the cancer will react to the drugs, what happens to vorinostat in the human body (how your body reacts to this drug and breaks it down) and about its side effects when used in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel).

The purpose of this study is to:

* Test the safety of the research study drug, vorinostat
* To determine if any toxicities or severe side effects occur when combining vorinostat with docetaxel (a standard chemotherapy treatment)
* To study how your body takes in, breaks down and responds to vorinostat
* To obtain more evidence of the ability of vorinostat to react against cancer, such as the kind that you have.

The use of vorinostat in combination with chemotherapy such as docetaxel may result in improved response of the cancer to treatment. Indeed, vorinostat may have an added benefit with docetaxel by promoting cancer cell death. This is because both drugs can interfere with the ability of the cancer to grow, although the way vorinostat does this is not clearly defined. Vorinostat and docetaxel both can disrupt the cancer's ability to produce daughter cancer cells and therefore, the administration of vorinostat before docetaxel is hoped to be better then either drug alone.",[],TERMINATED,closed due to toxicity,"[{'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid)', 'description': 'Vorinostat will be administered by mouth as a pill for the first 14 days on a continuous basis during of each 21-day cycle (2 weeks of treatment, 1 week break).', 'armGroupLabels': ['docetaxel plus vorinostat'], 'otherNames': ['Zolinza,NSC 701852']}, {'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'docetaxel', 'description': 'Docetaxel will be administered as an intravenous infusion (through the vein) on day 4 of each 21-day cycle.', 'armGroupLabels': ['docetaxel plus vorinostat'], 'otherNames': ['Taxotere']}]","['Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Prostate Cancer', 'Bladder Cancer', 'Urothelial Carcinoma']",University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center,"[{'type': 'drug', 'name': 'vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid)', 'description': 'vorinostat will be administered by mouth as a pill for the first 14 days on a continuous basis during of each 21-day cycle (2 weeks of treatment, 1 week break).', 'armgrouplabels': ['docetaxel plus vorinostat'], 'othernames': ['zolinza,nsc 701852']}, {'type': 'drug', 'name': 'docetaxel', 'description': 'docetaxel will be administered as an intravenous infusion (through the vein) on day 4 of each 21-day cycle.', 'armgrouplabels': ['docetaxel plus vorinostat'], 'othernames': ['taxotere']}]",True,closed due to toxicity,True,vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid)

Although EMR has been extensively studied in humans in a total of 18 Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, with an excellent safety and tolerance profile, it has not been used in the setting of COVID-19, therefore necessitating an initial safety and tolerability study looking at a no difference between AEs/SAEs for comparison between active and placebo group. The pharmacokinetics of EMR has been extensively studied; therefore, the Investigators will opportunistically sample patients at the end of the study to confirm that the Emricasan PK is not altered in COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint will be cumulative incidence of AE/SAEs through day 14.

NCT04140591,Proton Pump Inhibitor Plus Propranolol Versus Proton Pump Inhibitor Alone on Peptic Ulcer Healing in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis,"Portal hypertension is responsible for the development of portosystemic collaterals. The hemodynamic alternations may result in mucosal and vascular changes along gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well. According to several epidemiological studies, cirrhotic patients are at a higher risk of developing peptic ulcers, delayed healing, and a higher frequency of ulcer recurrence. The death rate from peptic ulcer disease in cirrhotic patients has been reported to be five times higher than that of the general population. The exact mechanism remains incompletely understood, but may be related to impaired mucosal defense mechanisms. Aggressive factors such as Helicobacter pylori and gastric acid may not be the predominant etiology in such circumstances. Sarfeh et al. found gastric mucosa of portal hypertensive rats, compared with that of controls, has distinctive functional and histologic abnormalities that can explain its increased susceptibility to erosive injury. Auroux et al. found gastroduodenal ulcer was independently associated only with the severity of the hypertensive gastropathy in cirrhotics. Chen et al. found portal hypertension with a hepatic venous pressure gradient \> 12 mmHg may be an important factor contributing to the increased prevalence of gastric ulcer observed in patients with liver cirrhosis. Thereby, we presumed that clinically significant portal hypertension may play a role in development of peptic ulcer in cirrhotic patients. Lebrec et al. elucidated non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) could significantly decrease portal pressure and lower the risk of GI bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Kitano et al. found portal hypotensive treatment with NSBB, reduces ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in portal hypertensive rats and improves endoscopic signs of portal hypertensive gastropathy in cirrhosis patients. We designed a 2-year randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitor with or without propranolol on ulcer healing and the incidence of ulcer bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and peptic ulcers.",[],TERMINATED,1.

NCT03685773,The Role of Hepatic Denervation in the Dysregulation of Glucose Metabolism in Liver Transplant Recipients,"In this study, investigators will study both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals who are otherwise healthy more than one year after receiving a liver transplant. They will participate in at least one of the following two parts of this study: The first involves functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the second is using a day-long infusion study called a ""pancreatic clamp.""

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique for measuring and mapping brain activity that is noninvasive and safe. This technique relies on the fact that blood flow in the brain and the activity of brain cells are coupled. Investigators will observe the activity of metabolically-relevant areas of the brain by activating potassium channels with diazoxide at baseline and at 2-hour intervals vs when given placebo.

In the pancreatic clamp study, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of sugar in the blood) are infused with an intravenous catheter. Blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found in the body which are related to glucose metabolism. The rates of endogenous glucose production (a measure of the body's production of sugar) will be measured as the main measurement of the study.

All participants will be screened prior to study enrollment. For the fMRI studies, eligible participants will come on two separate occasions for day-long study visits (one day in which the brain will be imaged before and after receiving diazoxide (a potassium channel activator), and one day in which the brain will be imaged before and after placebo. For the pancreatic clamp studies, eligible participants will come on two separate occasions for day-long study visits (one study with diazoxide, and one study with placebo). All studies in participants with type 2 diabetes will include overnight admissions prior to the study day for gradual normalizing of blood glucose through the infusion of insulin. Participants without diabetes will not have to stay for an overnight admission. Study participants with type 2 diabetes will also be eligible for an additional study in which Nicotinic Acid will be infused overnight to lower free fatty acid (FFA) levels. It will be determined whether FFA lowering will impact the fMRI studies and clamp studies that will be performed the next day.",[],WITHDRAWN,"Permanently terminated due to COVID-19 given the poor vaccine penetrance in liver transplant recipients.

The patients were planned to receive 50 mg ITF2357 four times a day at 6-hour intervals in fed conditions for 28 consecutive days unless evidence of progressive disease, presence of unacceptable adverse events or patient's request to discontinue treatment occurs.

Decision regarding the continuation of ITF2357 were made on:

* the basis of tumor reassessment upon completion of cycle defined as above and not later than 7 days and
* the occurred toxicity (if any).

If complete response or partial response or stabilization of disease after first cycle, without concomitant relevant toxicities is observed, the treatment may continue as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease or appearance of unacceptable adverse events.

In any case, the treatment is not planned to exceed 84 days of drug intake overall (i.e. 12 weeks).

The treatment is planned to be administered on an outpatient basis and patients are planned to be followed regularly with physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of hospitalization, the treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the Investigators' decision.

The study planned to accrue 23 patients evaluable for efficacy and the anticipated duration of the study is about 18 months.

NCT03531827,"Combining CRLX101, a Nanoparticle Camptothecin, With Enzalutamide in People With Progressive Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Following Prior Enzalutamide Treatment","Background:

* Enzalutamide is established as first-line hormonal therapy in participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, it is increasingly recognized that acquired resistance to therapy (e.g., androgen receptor (AR) overexpression, androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) could limit the durability of response to therapy
* Upregulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1Alpha) in hypoxic tumor cells provides a mechanism of acquired resistance to current hormonal therapies and chemotherapies. Acquired resistance increases angiogenesis and metastasis, leading to disease progression
* Targeting the hypoxia driven tumor microenvironment (e.g., down-regulation of HIF-1Alpha) in addition to the androgen receptor (e.g., enzalutamide) has synergistic activity against prostate cancer cell line models (e.g., LNCaP, 22Rv1).
* CRLX101 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20(S)-camptothecin (a potent and highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor with anti-HIF-1Alpha properties) conjugated to a linear, cyclodextrin-polyethylene glycol-based polymer
* CRLX101 has been shown to be safe, tolerable, and efficacious in numerous Phase II clinical investigations in a variety of tumor subtypes.
* Preclinical and clinical studies have shown CRLX101 significantly down-regulates HIF-1alpha, impacting tumor-driven angiogenesis.
* The treatment combination of CRLX101 and enzalutamide provides a reasonable approach to re-sensitizing prostate cancer cells to hormonal therapy via synergistic antitumor activity and inhibition of acquired resistance

Objectives:

-Primary Objective: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of CRLX101 at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in combination with enzalutamide with respect to treatment response, defined as greater than or equal to 50% PSA decline or stable disease on imaging following 5 months of treatment.

Eligibility:

* Patients must have progressive mCRPC per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3(PCWG3)
* Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to give informed consent
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status less than or equal to 2
* Evaluable metastatic disease on bone scan or measurable disease on computed tomography (CT) Scan per PCWG3 and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
* Patients must have had disease progression while receiving prior enzalutamide treatment

Design:

* The study will be conducted using an optimal two stage Phase II design (8 participants, expandable to 21 participants total) aimed to determine the percentage of participants with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of greater than 50% or stable disease at 5 months.
* The first 3 to 6 participants enrolled on study will follow a lead-in dosing scheme to confirm the safety of the combination (CRLX101 12 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks for the first two cycles, followed by CRLX101 15 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks at the start of cycle 3, with enzalutamide 160 mg administered once daily starting on cycle 1 day 2) prior to initiation of the optimal two stage study design.
* For participants enrolled on study following the lead-in, the confirmed tolerable dose of CRLX101 will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks. Enzalutamide 160 mg will be administered orally once daily beginning on cycle 1 day 2.
* Blood and urine will be collected at multiple time points for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD0 analyses.
* Tumor assessments will be made using Technetium-99 (99Tc) bone scintigraphy and/or CT scan (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) at baseline, prior to Cycle 3 and every 3 cycles thereafter.

NCT01545427,Proof of Concept Trial of Gleevec (Imatinib) in Active Diffuse Scleroderma,"Purpose:

Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that is prototypical for fibrosis with autoantibodies and vascular abnormalities including vasomotor instability (Raynaud's) at one end and blood vessel obliteration at the other (1,2). Scleroderma occurs in \> 2/10,000 (with thousands of Canadians affected) and has no proven therapy to modify the disease overall (3). The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of Gleevec to be used as a novel therapy in the treatment of scleroderma.

Background:

There are two subtypes of systemic scleroderma: diffuse and limited (2). Limited skin involvement includes skin involvement distal to the elbows and knees and may include the neck and face, but spares the trunk and proximal extremities. Diffuse scleroderma has more extensive skin involvement including trunk or proximal extremities and is associated with more internal organ involvement and increased mortality (4). For instance, significant interstitial lung disease, cardiomyopathy and scleroderma renal crisis are more common in diffuse scleroderma than limited. The extent of organ involvement in these areas may correlate with the extent of skin involvement and worsening skin involvement is associated with increased mortality and worse overall health function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (5).

Formulation of Objective:

Various signals that could be therapeutically down regulated in scleroderma such as PDGF, VEGF, endothelin, and TGFβ are potential therapeutic targets. The inhibition of tyrosine kinase can decrease cell growth and could be a key signal modifier in scleroderma (6). Signal transduction modification with selected targets has been very successful in the treatment of some cancers, such as using Gleevec in chronic myelocytic leukemia (7).

Gleevec (imatinib) is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of CML and some GI stromal tumors, with a reduction in mortality in CML. Tyrosine kinase activates PDGF and TGFbeta, which are key signals in scleroderma so a proof of concept study is needed to determine if there is a biological signal to proceed in a disease of fibrosis such as scleroderma. PDGF regulation is important in fibrotic diseases by stimulating replication and migration of myofibroblasts (8).

Protocol:

Subjects with active diffuse scleroderma will be enrolled after consenting and will receive Gleevec 400mg/od or placebo. Serum and skin biopsies will be collected for biomarkers. Serum samples will be taken at baseline, 3 and 6 months and analyzed by ELISA/multiplexing for changes in profibrotic cytokines including PDGF, VEGF, endothelin, and TGFβ. Skin biopsies will be taken prior to the first dose and at 6 months. Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), MD and patient global assessments will also be done at times 0, 3, and 6 months. SF36 and Health Transition Score will be done at 0 and 6 months. Biochemistry for safety and inflammation will be done once a month for the duration of the trial.

Gleevec at 400 mg/od or placebo will be given orally with food and a large glass of water for 6 months. As this is a proof of concept and Phase IIa trial they will be randomized into active vs. placebo groups in a 4:1 ratio, where n=20. Therefore, 16 patients will receive active drug and 4 will receive placebo.

Specific Aims:

1. Primary outcome measurement: changes in cytokine expression in skin biopsies and serum samples for profibrotic cytokines.
2. To determine the between groups differences from baseline to final skin score on Gleevec and placebo at 6 months using the Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS).
3. To compare the AEs (adverse events) and SAEs (serious adverse events) between the groups.
4. Secondary objectives will be:

Comparing secondary outcome measurements such as: MD global, patient global, HAQ, SF36, Health Transition, ESR, CRP.

Randomization and Blinding:

The randomization will be stratified by current use of methotrexate. It is anticipated that the majority of patients in this trial will not be taking methotrexate at time of randomization, but stratification should balance the groups if there is a heterogenous response. The randomization will be done in balanced blocks of 5, after stratification by methotrexate use. The pharmacy will be called and will provide the medication and will have the randomization code. The trial is blinded where the patient, the research nurse performing study procedures including dispensing the study drug, and the physician doing the outcome assessments will all be unaware of treatment allocation.

Concomitant Medications:

Stable dose concomitant methotrexate of up to 25 mg/week if tolerated (po or sc) can be continued throughout the study. In addition, if necessary, folate can be added or increased to decrease side effects.

All standard of care is allowed except for the medications listed above. Thus treatment for GERD, Raynaud's, digital ulcers, HTN, delayed GI emptying, small bowel overgrowth, Sjogren's symptoms, arthritis (using NSAIDs or low dose prednisone) is allowed. Severe PAH and severe ILD is excluded as there could be expectations that this comorbidity may interfere with the current 24-week treatment protocol. Steroids can be increased in the rare chance that a patient develops a complication or co-morbidity that requires higher doses of steroids as part of standard care. Regular need for antibiotics for small bowel overgrowth is allowed.

Good clinical practice will be followed and other appropriate treatment will not be denied. This is an 'add-on' treatment to standard care. Concomitant medications will be assumed to be held stable throughout the study. Patients taking any medications that may interact with Gleevec (eg. SSRIs, TCA, trazadone, benzodiazepines, betablockers, etc.) will be monitored cautiously.

Since Gleevec has been postulated (by a case report) to improve pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) annual echocardiograms that are done as part of standard care may be compared between the groups determining the estimated PAP on echocardiogram (9).

AEs and SAEs:

The University of Western Ontario Ethics Committee will approve the protocol and any amendments and will be informed of any SAEs as per usual research conduct. The patients are free to withdraw consent or drop out at any time with no adverse effect on their future care. As per any trial, AEs and SAEs will be collected. SAEs will be reported in an expedited way to the UWO Ethics Committee and Novartis.

Pregnancies:

Pregnancy or fathering of a child, although not itself a serious adverse event, should also be reported on a serious adverse event form or pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities. In addition to any pregnancy or fathering of a child within 84 days (12 weeks or 3 months) after the last Gleevec intake has to be reported and recorded as an SAE.

Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported using a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. To ensure patient safety each pregnancy must also be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications.

Patients will be informed of the risks involved in becoming pregnant while taking Gleevec in the Letter of Information and female partners of male study participants will be required to read and sign a ""Pregnant Partner Data Release Form"" acknowledging that they have been informed of these risks as well.

Discontinuation of Treatment:

The patients are free to drop out at any time. A severe allergic reaction will necessitate withdrawal. If there are sustained cytopenias (WBC \<2.0, Hbg \< 8.0 or Plt \< 50,000) for 2 infusions in a row then the patient will be withdrawn. If there is a WBC \< 1.0 or Hbg \< 7.5 or Plt \< 10,000 at any time, the patient will be withdrawn. If there are sustained elevations of AST/ALT twice in a row, of twice the upper limit of normal, then the methotrexate will be decreased by 5 mg/week. If the elevation persists for 2 more tests, the methotrexate will be held for two weeks and the liver enzymes repeated. If still elevated, the methotrexate will be cut in half and if still elevated and no other concomitant meds are thought to be causing the elevation, then the patient will be withdrawn.

Sample Size:

This study is a pilot and is not anticipated to have enough power to have a statistically significant between groups difference on skin score. However, the effects on fibrosis and other mediators in serum and tissue specimens may help to determine if a larger trial should be a 'go' or 'no go'.

Analysis:

This will be a modified intent to treat analysis, where any patient receiving at least one dose of the study drug will be analyzed, and for dropouts the last observation will be carried forward (LOCF). The primary outcome measurement will be changes in profibrotic cytokine expression in serum and urine samples and skin biopsies. Multiplexing will be used to measure up to 30 analytes of interest in one 50ul sample of any biological fluid. Statistics will include the between groups (active and placebo) difference at 24 weeks (6 months) in the MRSS. There will be a between groups assessment of HAQ, ESR and CRP for placebo compared to Gleevec. The SF36 and Health Transition Scores will be compared using paired tests. AEs and SAEs will be quantified and compared between placebo and active treatment. PK and PD data will only be analyzed if there is a thought of continuing drug development in this area. If the data appear to demonstrate some benefit, then a repeated measures ANOVA will be done to determine if there are between groups differences at various time points.

Data Safety Monitoring Board:

All SAEs will be reported to the Ethics Committee and to Novartis. An independent safety board blinded to treatment allocation will meet at 3 months to monitor study progress and SAEs. There will be no interim analysis, as the study is not powered to do one. Safety events will be collected up until one month after discontinuing study drug in all cases wherever possible.",[],TERMINATED,Frequent adverse events occurred early in treatment with poor tolerability.,"[{'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'Imatinib mesylate', 'description': '200 mg bid for 6 months', 'armGroupLabels': ['Gleevec'], 'otherNames': ['Gleevec']}, {'type': 'OTHER', 'name': 'Placebo', 'description': 'Placebo coated to match appearance of Gleevec identically.', 'armGroupLabels': ['Placebo']}]",['Scleroderma'],London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute OR Lawson Research Institute of St. Joseph's,"[{'type': 'drug', 'name': 'imatinib mesylate', 'description': '200 mg bid for 6 months', 'armgrouplabels': ['gleevec'], 'othernames': ['gleevec']}, {'type': 'other', 'name': 'placebo', 'description': 'placebo coated to match appearance of gleevec identically.', 'armgrouplabels': ['placebo']}]",True,frequent adverse events occurred early in treatment with poor tolerability.,True,imatinib mesylate
NCT00953576,"Ketoconazole, Hydrocortisone, Dutasteride and Lapatinib (KHAD-L) in Prostate Cancer","The current study builds on investigators' KHAD experience by further targeting pathways that may still be enhancing AR activity despite reduced testosterone and DHT. Importantly, studies from several groups have shown that EGFR and Her2/Neu activation can enhance AR signaling and increase AR transcriptional activity in response to low levels of androgens. Evaluation in the clinic and lab has shown that there is increased expression of EGFR or Her2/Neu in CRPC. In addition to upregulation in EGFR and Her2/Neu protein expression, signaling through these receptors may be enhanced in some tumors by increases in growth factor levels or other mechanisms. Based on these results, the investigators suggest that EGFR and Her2/Neu contribute to enhancing AR transcriptional activity especially at low androgen levels. If this hypothesis is correct, then dual blockade of EGFR and Her2/Neu in CRPC should enhance the ability of KHAD to abrogate AR activity.

NCT03593694,Technology Delivered Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment,"Diabetes Mellitus is highly prevalent in the United States (CDC 2014) and African Americans (AA) are disproportionately affected and have higher prevalence, poorer metabolic control and greater risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. Evidence from the literature show that effective interventions for AAs with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have multiple components including: education and skills training, nurse case management, and maintain high intensity. However, few large Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT) have tested multi-component interventions that include these key components in AAs with T2DM.

Behavioral Activation is a psychotherapeutic process whereby patients are encouraged to identify and schedule structured and enjoyable activities for behavior change that are likely to improve outcomes such as mood, behaviors and quality of life. A brief manualized behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD), has been modified for diabetes.

This study tests a multi-component, high intensity intervention that incorporates several strategies that have been shown to be effective in improving diabetes outcomes in AAs.

Subjects must have mild-moderate AD involving at least 5% treatable %BSA assessed on baseline/Day 1. Treatable %BSA will be defined as the percent of a subject's total body surface area that is AD involved, excluding the scalp.

Eligible subjects will be randomized at the Baseline/Day 1 visit. Randomization will be stratified by eligibility for TCS or TCI treatment as per national approved labels. Cohort 1 will be for subjects who are eligible for TCS therapy, and Cohort 2 will be for subjects who are not eligible for TCS therapy but eligible for TCI therapy. The investigational products will be applied BID for 28 days to the Treatable body surface area (BSA) identified at Baseline/Day 1.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score at Day 29.

For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle, subjects from both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 are included in the analysis, adjusted for cohort effect. For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus TCS, only subjects from Cohort 1 are included in the analysis. For the comparison of crisaborole versus TCI, only subjects from Cohort 2 are included in the analysis.

Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at the investigator site by a clinical assessor blinded to treatment assignment.

Scheduled study visits for all subjects will occur at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (End of treatment/Early termination), Day 43 or 14 Days after last dose if subject is terminated early from treatment. A follow up telephone call will be made by site staff to the subjects/subject's legally acceptable guardian(s) on Day 60 or at least 28 days after last dose if subject is terminated early from treatment. The Day 60 visit will be completed in the clinic for subjects enrolled in the OCT sub-study.

To further explore the benefit/risk of crisaborole ointment, 2%, a sub-study to evaluate differences in atrophic skin changes across study treatment groups in Cohort 1 will be conducted at select sites.

The sub-study will include obtaining Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to evaluate atrophic changes in epidermal thickness during and after treatment with study investigational product in Cohort 1. This sub-study also provides an opportunity to explore differences in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) and cutaneous inflammatory and barrier biomarkers associated with AD within the stratum corneum (SC) across treatment groups in Cohort 1. The Aquaflux (an evaporimeter) will be used in this sub-study to evaluate TEWL during and after treatment at select sub-study centers. Tape-strips will also be used in this sub-study to evaluate SC biomarkers from AD lesional and non-lesional skin.

This sub-study will include approximately 60 subjects from Cohort 1 that are enrolled in the main study (C3291037).

The 36-week double-blind, randomized treatment phase of the trial is preceded by 2-week single-blind placebo period to assess eligibility into the active treatment period, compliance, and to confirm the baseline blood pressure values of the enrolled subjects. If at the end of the single-blind phase, inclusion criteria will not be met, the participants will not be allowed to continue on to the trial. If they are eligible they will undergo baseline MRI studies after being randomized to either placebo or Aliskiren 150 mg, with an escalation to 300 mg at 2 weeks into treatment. This dose will be maintained for the duration of the trial. After randomization and dose escalation visits (at 2 weeks), patients will return for scheduled clinic visits at weeks 12 and 36. Assessment of routine safety measures including serum creatinine and potassium will be performed at pre-designated visits (randomization, drug escalation and end-of trial). At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for 5 minutes, SBP/diastolic blood pressure will be measured 3 times in accordance with the AHA Committee Report on blood pressure determination. The patient will be then asked to stand for 2 minutes, and a single blood pressure measurement will be measured in the standing position. Evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will be determined using the Romhilt-Estes scoring system at baseline. Specialized measurements of plasma including insulin, glucose measures, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) and high- sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) will be performed at randomization and 12 weeks into the trial.

NCT05125679,Effect of Guselkumab on Cardiovascular Risk Surrogate Markers in Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects 2 percent (%)-3% of the population and has an impact on physical and emotional health-related quality-of-life that is comparable to major illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and depression. Guselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) with high specificity and affinity. Binding of guselkumab to the IL-23 p19 subunit blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23 specific intracellular signaling and subsequent cytokine production. Guselkumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of guselkumab in reducing surrogate parameters of vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study will consist of two Screening Visits (Screening Visit S1 at a maximum of 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit S2, to occur at a minimum of 2 weeks and maximum of 4 weeks prior to Week 0), a Treatment Phase (up to 28 weeks), Final Efficacy Visit 4 weeks later (Week 32), and Final Safety Visit (Week 40).

NCT02362321,Role of Dexamethasone in the Conservative Treatment of Chronic Subdural Hematoma,"Patients Recruitment for this single-center double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study was performed between January 2007 and May 2009. Patients were enrolled based on the following inclusion criteria: 18 years and older with evidence of subacute or chronic supratentorial subdural hematoma by CT (computerized tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and classified between 0 and 2 using the Markwalder grading scale (17) (Grade 0 for normal neurological status, grade 1 for no neurological deficits but mild symptoms, grade 2 for focal or variable neurological deficits, grade 3 for several focal neurological signs, and grade 4 for comatose). Exclusion criteria included contraindications or intolerance to corticosteroid therapy or patients already undergoing steroid treatment for any other indication, previous neurological surgery up to one year prior to being considered for the study, concomitant cerebral pathology of neoplastic or presumed infectious origin, anticoagulant therapy that could not be stopped for 6 months and refusal to participate in the study. If at any time, patients developed a sudden increase in hematoma volume, a midline displacement of greater than 1cm or a deterioration of their level of consciousness, they were removed from the conservative study protocol in order to undergo surgery.

This study was approved by the research ethics board at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec. Written and fully informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Randomization Allocation to each group was done in a 1:1 ratio with block sizes ranging from 4 to 6, to one of the two arms ; a treatment arm in which participants received dexamethasone according to the protocol, and a control group in which they received placebo. Randomization was performed via a web-based service by a pharmacist, which was not involved in any other part of the study. Both investigators and participants were blind to treatment allocation.

Treatment Participants allocated to the treatment group received a daily dosage of 12mg (4mg three times a day) of dexamethasone for three weeks. Corticosteroid treatment was then tapered off over the next week (8mg for 48 hrs, 4mg for 48 hrs, 2mg for 48 hrs and 1mg for 24 hrs). Identical oral capsules filled with lactose were administered to the control (placebo) group for 28 days. Participants were returned at home with blister packs containing their medication for each day of the trial and were asked to return empty packs to ensure compliance with the assigned treatment. The treatment (placebo or dexamethasone) was discontinued if a patient required surgical drainage of its hematoma or suffered from significant side effects.

Evaluation and follow-up The primary outcome of this pilot study was to determine the efficacy of dexamethasone as compared with placebo in reducing the rate of surgical intervention for CSDH graded 0 to 2 on the Markwalder grading scale (Grade 0 for normal neurological status, grade 1 for no neurological deficits but mild symptoms, grade 2 for focal or variable neurological deficits, grade 3 for several focal neurological signs, and grade 4 for comatose).

Eligible patients who consented for the study underwent the routine standard of care. This included 1) a complete medical history review and neurological physical exam ; 2) head computerized tomography (CT) or MRI with measurement of maximal hematoma thickness (in mm), midline shift ; 3) and a check of blood and vital parameters. In addition, patients were asked to complete detailed questionnaires measuring symptoms typically associated with subdural hematomas.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled 2 weeks, 1, 2 and 6 months after initiation of treatment. At each visit, the three components of the clinical evaluation described above were repeated. Moreover, a seven point categorical scale was used to evaluate patient's global impression of change relative to the initial state (unchanged , very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse). Treatment-related side effects were also inquired about and collected.

The rate of success of conservative management was defined as the percentage of patients not requiring surgery in each treatment group during the 6 months following enrollment. Radiological progression of the hematoma in terms of thickness and magnitude of midline shift, hematoma-related symptoms and medication-related side effects were carefully collected.

Statistical analyses Demographical characteristics, baseline neurological status and hematoma size and location were compared for both groups using a Mann-Whitney test for continuous variable and a χ2 test for categorical variables.

To compare the rate of success, a categorical frequency comparison with the Fisher's exact test was used. For the other outcome measures we used Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t-test for normally distributed variables and χ2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical frequencies. All statistical tests were done with the Statistical package for Social Sciences software version 16.0 and the significance threshold was set at p\<0.05.",[],TERMINATED,Due to serious adverse events,"[{'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'Dexamethasone', 'description': 'Patients received a daily dosage of 12mg (4mg three times a day) of dexamethasone for three weeks.

Fasiglifam is being tested to treat people who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and are currently taking sitagliptin (with or without metformin). This study will evaluate glycemic control in people who take fasiglifam plus sitagliptin compared with placebo plus sitagliptin.

The study will enroll approximately 390 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need; all participants will be on 100 mg sitagliptin and may or may not be on metformin background treatment):

* fasiglifam 50 mg
* Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study.

This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Latin America. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 38 weeks. Participants will make 15 visits to the clinic.

NCT05360264,tailOred dRug repurposIng of dEcitabine in KRAS-dependeNt refracTory pAncreaTic cancEr,"TYPE OF STUDY: Phase II study, open label, multicentre, single arm, interventional, Non-randomized ￼ TARGET POPULATION: Advanced (locally advanced or metastatic), pre-treated PDAC patients, progressing after at least one and no more than two lines of systemic therapy, whose tumors express a KRAS-dependency signature.

￼ RATIONALE. BACKGROUND: KRAS gene mutations occur in 95% of PDAC. Inhibitors targeting the prevalent KRASG12V and KRASG12D mutations in PDAC have yet to reach the clinical setting. Oncogenic KRAS-driven signatures have been derived from PDAC cancer models. Based on these, it is possible to identify a subset of PDACs that are highly addicted to oncogenic KRAS, and referred to as KRAS-dependent tumors (dKRAS), in which the direct targeting of KRAS or KRAS-dependent phenotypes reduced tumor growth. Notably, KRAS dependency was associated with a rewiring of nucleotide metabolism and the inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis was sufficient to inhibit the growth of dKRAS PDAC cells. In contrast, tumors that, though harboring KRAS mutations, do not display KRAS dependency are resistant to anti-KRAS targeting.

Decitabine (DEC) is FDA-approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. Importantly, phase-I and -II clinical trials of DEC have defined a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for DEC monotherapy in solid tumors.

HYPOTHESES AND RATIONALE: Preclinical studies show that DEC has cytotoxic activity and inhibits the growth of dKRAS PDAC, whereas KRAS-independent PDACs are not responsive. Based on solid preclinical studies and the scientific literature, the investigators' hypotheses are that: i) DEC is a potent anticancer drug inhibiting pyrimidine homeostasis and eliciting DNA damage in PDAC with a KRAS dependency; ii) The KRAS dependency of tumors can be analytically defined by computational scores based on the analysis of the gene expression signature on tumor biopsy; iii) These genetic scores might have a prognostic value. Based on these hypotheses, the investigators propose a proof-of-concept, biomarker-driven, phase-II clinical trial to explore the activity of DEC repurposing against advanced, refractory KRAS-dependent PDAC.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the trial is to provide proof-of-concept of DEC antitumor activity in dKRAS metastatic PDAC.

Secondary objectives of the trial are to assess the feasibility of a molecularly tailored approach in advanced, pre-treated PDAC, as well as to assess treatment safety and tolerability, clinical benefit, impact on quality of life, and survival outcomes.",[],TERMINATED,Unexpected toxicity events were documented during interim safety evaluations of the investigational drug.,"[{'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'Decitabine 50 MG [Dacogen]', 'description': 'DACOGEN will be administered i.v. over 1 hour, at the dose of 10 mg/m2/d, daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 4-wk cycle.', 'armGroupLabels': ['Experimental group'], 'otherNames': ['Dacogen']}]","['Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Metastatic', 'Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Recurrent']",Luca Cardone,"[{'type': 'drug', 'name': 'decitabine 50 mg [dacogen]', 'description': 'dacogen will be administered i.v. over 1 hour, at the dose of 10 mg/m2/d, daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 4-wk cycle.', 'armgrouplabels': ['experimental group'], 'othernames': ['dacogen']}]",True,unexpected toxicity events were documented during interim safety evaluations of the investigational drug.,True,decitabine 50 mg [dacogen]

NCT00687674,"Sorafenib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate and lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (phase I)
* To describe the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (phase I)
* To evaluate the confirmed response in patients treated with this regimen. (phase II)

Secondary

* To correlate clinical effects (adverse events and/or tumor response or activity) with pharmacologic parameters (pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) and/or biologic results (correlative laboratory). (phase II)
* To assess overall survival and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. (phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate in combination with lenalidomide followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate once to twice daily on days 1-28, oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection periodically during study for laboratory correlative studies. Bone marrow plasma samples (i.e., fresh marrow aspirates) are assessed for marrow angiogenesis (microvessel density) by IHC; angiogenic capability (tubular network formation) by in vitro angiogenesis assay; tumor cell proliferation by bromo-2-deoxyuridine uptake; tumor cell apoptosis by three-color flow cytometry (CD38, CD45 or CD138, and 7AAD); and expression of VEGF and soluble VEGF receptors on plasma cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bone marrow biopsies are assessed for various phosphoproteins by IHC; phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 by immunoblotting; and for pharmacodynamic markers (e.g., P70 S6K) by immunoblotting. Blood samples are assessed for surface markers of circulating endothelial cells (CD105, CD34, and CD146) by flow cytometry and for circulating endothelial cell progenitors by late colony formation in mononuclear cells. The endothelial lineage is confirmed by phenotyping of surface markers for endothelial cells.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

A minimum of 150 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of two GSK2248761 doses or a control regimen containing ETV (50 subjects per group); all subjects will also receive darunavir/ritonavir and raltegravir. The trial will be partially blinded, i.e. subjects receiving GSK2248761 and the investigators will be blinded to the dose they receive. Subjects will not be blinded to whether they receive GSK2248761 or ETV.

Randomization will be stratified by:

* HIV-1 VL at screening, \<50,000 copies/mL or \>/50,000 copies/mL, and
* Darunavir susceptibility (screening phenotype fold change \<7 or \>/7 to 20)

Background ART will be administered open-label.

The primary endpoint analysis will take place after all subjects have completed Week 16. An optimal dose of GSK2248761 will be determined by the Week 16 analysis; this dose selection will be confirmed using an analysis from all subjects following completion of Week 24. If there is a clear efficacy, safety or tolerability advantage driving dose selection for GSK2248761, then all subjects receiving the non-selected dose of GSK2248761 will be switched to the selected dose following dose confirmation, after all subjects have completed Week 24. If no differentiation of dose can be made based on objective measures of efficacy, safety or tolerability, then both doses will be continued through Week 48.

After Week 48, all subjects will be expected to obtain local access to all commercially available ART.

No regimen switches of either background ART (DRV/r and RAL) or test agent or control (GSK2248761 and ETV) are allowed during the 48 week period of the study.

Study Endpoints/Assessments Subjects will have assessments performed which will include baseline demographics, disease characteristics, pharmacogenetics (PGx) and safety (laboratory and clinical evaluations). On study safety, efficacy, virologic, immunologic, and PK evaluations will also be conducted.

The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA \<50copies/mL at Week 16. Dose selection will be based primarily on antiviral activity and tolerability in conjunction with immunologic, safety, virologic resistance and PK measures. Data from the Week 24 analysis will be used to confirm dose selection.

NCT01110226,Trial Of Cisplatin And KML-001 in Platinum Responsive Malignancies,"Telomerase is the enzyme synthesizing the specific DNA sequences found at the telomeres in the body's chromosomes. It is thus responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres. Telomerase has been detected in human cancer cells and is found to be 10-20 times more active than in normal body cells. This provides a selective growth advantage to many types of tumors. If telomerase activity was to be turned off, then telomeres in cancer cells would shorten, just like they do in normal body cells. This would prevent the cancer cells from dividing uncontrollably in their early stages of development. In the event that a tumor has already thoroughly developed, it may be removed and anti-telomerase therapy could be administered to prevent relapse.

This study is being offered to patients with advanced cancer which has either no standard therapy or which has progressed after treatment with one or more standard treatments.

The primary objective of this study :

To determine the maximum tolerated dose of KML001 in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced malignancy. This objective has been met. The study will be reopened with expansion cohorts in advanced small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer to better assess the activity of the combination, pending (Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.

Secondary Objectives of the study:

To determine the pharmacokinetics of KML001 and cisplatin in this combination. To assess the response rate, disease-free survival and survival associated with this regimen.

To correlate indications of patient benefit (response or stable disease) with pretreatment specimens

The highest safest doses are determined by increasing the doses of cisplatin and KML001 in successive groups of patients until at least some of them have serious side effects. All patients on this study will receive the same dose of cisplatin, which is known to have antitumor effects. The doses of KML001 will be increased in successive groups of patients. It is possible that those entering the study early may receive suboptimal doses of KML001. At the end of the study we hope to determine the appropriate dose of the KML001 in combination with cisplatin, learn about its side effects and understand how the body metabolizes the drug.

Laboratory data from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) has demonstrated that the combination of KML001 and cisplatin is synergistic in lung cancer cell lines. Cisplatin is the best established agent for the treatment of lung cancer and most treatment regimens have been established with cisplatin (or its congener, carboplatin).

In Part A of the study, patients already receiving intravenous antibacterial therapy with another antibiotic will receive a single intravenous dose of ceftazidime-avibactam followed by observation for 48 hours and a Late Follow-Up assessment 4-5 weeks later. In Part B of the study, patients with suspected or confirmed Gram-negative bacterial infections requiring intravenous antibacterial therapy will receive multiple doses of intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam for up to 14 days. At the discretion of the investigator, patients may also receive other antibiotics if the infection is suspected to include Gram-positive bacteria, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, or anaerobic bacteria. At the discretion of the investigator, patients may be switched to oral therapy or outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy with an alternative antibiotic after receiving intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam for at least 48 yhours. Clinical outcomes will be assessed at the End of Intravenous (EOIV) treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam, the End-of-Therapy (EOT), the Test-of-Cure (TOC) at 7-14 days after the last study therapy and at a Late Follow-Up (LFU) visit, 28-55 days after the last dose of ceftazidime-avibactam. Safety assessments will occur throughout the study. Ceftazidime-avibactam blood levels will be assessed during the first 12 hours after the single dose of ceftazidime-avibactam in Part A and during 12 hours after at least 3 consecutive doses of ceftazidime-avibactam in Part B.",[],TERMINATED,"Following regulatory consultation, the Sponsor has decided to terminate the study and analyze the current dataset.
